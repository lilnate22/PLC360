I feel like a blind man at silent movie....
anyway the Parser should be working as intended, however, i dont know how to invoke them properly.
also there might be some syntax errors, in terms of indentation. i wrote this in Windows, and then FTPed it to tux.
it worked on tux, and then some random times, it gave me errors about indentation.
